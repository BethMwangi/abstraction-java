<h1>Understanding Abstraction in Java</h1>
<p>In computer science, abstraction is the process by which data and programs are defined with a representation similar in form to its meaning (semantics), while hiding away the implementation details.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://harrisonkamau.github.io/code-ninja/Object-Oriented-Programming/">object-oriented programming</a> theory, abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract “actors” that can perform work, report on and change their state, and “communicate” with other objects in the system.</p>
